\section{Latest experience}
\cventry{November~2017 present}{Engineer}{\href{http://twitter.com}{Twitter}}{London}{}{I'm a part of the GraphQL team at Twitter, working on rearchitecting internal API and the way production features are built at Twitter.\newline}%
\cventry{February~2014 November~2017}{Engineer}{\href{http://soundcloud.com}{SoundCloud}}{Berlin}{}{I have worked in several teams at SoundCloud. Most recently, I was a part of the activities team where my work consised of scaling and implementing the highest throughput systems at SoundCloud, i.e. systems that power the front page, notifications and social graph features.\newline{}\newline{}%
Before that I was a part of the creators team where I focused on features that help creators reach a wider audience, such as, services for creator stats, in-app messages, coordinating track creation, rss-feeds and the transcoding flow. Additionally, I bootstrapped services for serving content to stations and services for the bulk content ingestion pipeline for partners.\newline{}\newline{}%
Finally, when I joined SoundCloud I was a part of the core services team. There I took care of services used by all teams such as geo, authorizations and rollout services. Additionally, I took care of libraries built on top of Finagle to provide developers with tools to bootstrap and evolve their services quickly and intuitively.\newline}%
\cventry{January~2013 January~2014}{Quantitative Developer}{\href{http://deltamethod.com}{deltamethod}}{Berlin}{}{Worked on a backend for recommendation services.\newline{}%
I worked on the development of a recommendation system for improving online ads and ad campaigns that predicts their success and suggests possible improvements. I implemented various machine learning algorithms in Scala/Python and produced functional code that scales to big amounts of data.\newline}%
\cventry{February~2011 December~2012}{Scala Developer}{\href{http://thenewmotion.com}{The New Motion}}{Kyiv and Amsterdam}{}{
  I was the second person joining the client's remote dev team (9 people at the time of me leaving). Had a chance to work on / initiate / lead all the projects the company worked on.\newline}

\subsection{Other}
\cventry{}{\href{https://github.com/folone}{Open Source}}{}{}{}{I'm constantly involved in open source development with various communities. Several examples would be -- working on Lightbend and Typelevel Scala, specifically on \href{http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/42.type.html}{SIP-23}; working on the twitter libraries stack (utils, finagle).\newline}%
\cventry{}{\href{http://lanyrd.com/profile/folone/}{Public Speaking}}{}{}{}{I'm a frequent speaker at primarily Scala-centered, but also functional-programming-centered conferences.}
