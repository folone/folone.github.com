# So what's the big deal?

> A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the big deal?

> A lens is just a monoid natural transformation from the coalgebra functiors from haskell functors to haskell types, what's the big deal?

* * *

>Non-breaking error handling is just an applicative functor on a partially applied disjoint union type constructor with semigroup error elements so what's the big deal?
